# Neural Machine Translation: German to English

Welcome to the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project! This repository demonstrates the process of building a system capable of translating German sentences into their English counterparts using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the task of translating German sentences into English. Leveraging the power of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), this system provides an efficient way to bridge the language gap.

## Problem Statement

Imagine learning German, but instead of manually translating words and sentences, you could make your machine do the work! The objective of this project is to create a robust NMT system that translates German sentences into English with high accuracy.
